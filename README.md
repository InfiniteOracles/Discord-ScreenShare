# Discord-ScreenShare

## Overview
This is a fun project that continuously takes screenshots of your screen and sends them to Discord. Think of it as a quirky screen-sharing tool!

## How to Use
1. **Setup**:
   - Insert your Discord token.
   - Specify the path where you want to save the screenshots.

2. **Higher Performance**:
   - For those interested in a bit more efficiency, you can try porting this tool to use [DXcam](https://github.com/ra1nty/DXcam). I might do this in the future too!
